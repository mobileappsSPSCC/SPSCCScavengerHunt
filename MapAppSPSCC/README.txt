This application is based on work by Souleymane Dembele, as part of an unpaid internship he completed 12/2018.

The bulk of the code and work is his!

Later contributions from MCH include things like:
  Minor code revisions/cleanup
  Minor feature tweaks as requested by outreach/marketing
  Adding/linking to additional building images supplied after the end of the internship
  Release engineering for Android and iOS

  Several important pieces (like signing certificates and how-to maintenance documentation) are backed up on in OneDrive for mobileapps@spscc.edu.
  Authorized maintainers should contact IT for information on how to access that account.
